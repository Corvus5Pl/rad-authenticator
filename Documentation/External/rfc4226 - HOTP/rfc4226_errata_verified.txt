Section 9 says:

   Oracle AuthO()
   --------------
      A = ALG(K,C)
      C = C + 1
      Return O to B
It should say:

   Oracle AuthO()
   --------------
      A = ALG(K,C)
      C = C + 1
      Return A to B
             ^^
Notes:


Section A.4.1, Paragraph 3, Lemma 1 definition, top of page 19

The description of Lemma 1 defines P_ {N,m} (z) using the term Z_ {n}
and it should actually be Z_ {N}.
P_{N,m}(z) = Pr [x mod m = z : x randomly pick in Z_{n}]
Should be:
P_{N,m}(z) = Pr [x mod m = z : x randomly pick in Z_{N}]

Section E.2, Paragraph 4, bottom of page 32
32^8 > 10^12 so the security of an 8-alphanumeric HOTP code is
significantly better than a 9-digit HOTP value.
Should be:
32^8 > 10^12 so the security of an 8-alphanumeric HOTP code is
significantly better than a 12-digit HOTP value.
