Section 4.2 says:

The provisioning flow is out of scope of this document; refer to
[RFC6030] for such provisioning container specifications.
Notes:

It's insufficient to simply refer to RFC6030 here. See RFC6030 §4.3.4 where it states that the precise semantics of fields such as the <Suite> element are defined according to the algorithm profile. It does provide in §10 the definitions for HOTP and PIN algorithms — but it doesn't give them for TOTP because the standardisation of TOTP came later.

So *someone* needs to tell us what strings to put in the <Suite> element to indicate SHA1/SHA256/SHA512 etc. Either an update to RFC6030, or I would have thought it was better done with a section in RFC6238... which is missing.

Am I missing something?

Section Appendix A says:

 public static String generateTOTP(String key,
             String time,
             String returnDigits){
         return generateTOTP(key, time, returnDigits, "HmacSHA1");
     }
Notes:

Function will be recursive on his self. Maybe forget a second condition or statement?

Section Appendix B says:

The test token shared secret uses the ASCII string value
   "12345678901234567890"
It should say:

The test token used for each SHA mode is:
// Seed for HMAC-SHA1 - 20 bytes
         String seed = "3132333435363738393031323334353637383930";
         // Seed for HMAC-SHA256 - 32 bytes
         String seed32 = "3132333435363738393031323334353637383930" +
         "313233343536373839303132";
         // Seed for HMAC-SHA512 - 64 bytes
         String seed64 = "3132333435363738393031323334353637383930" +
         "3132333435363738393031323334353637383930" +
         "3132333435363738393031323334353637383930" +
         "31323334";
Notes:

The text suggests that the secret "12345678901234567890" is used, when in fact this value cannot be found in the reference implementation test generation code and leads to different values (as is expected). The actual secret used is called seed, seed32 and seed64 in the reference implementation test generation code.
