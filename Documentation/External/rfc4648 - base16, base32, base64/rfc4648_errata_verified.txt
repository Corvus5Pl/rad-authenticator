It should say:

http://zgp.org/pipermail/p2p-hackers/2001-September/000316.html
Notes:

The same "off by one" issue was already present in RFC 3548 (obsoleted by RFC 4648). The archived article 315 has another author. Articles 316 and 319 are from the author noted in the RFCs, belong to a discussion of "web-safe base64" formats (incl. hex. + base32 alternatives), and specify the relevant base64 modification:

316 is shorter than 319, and nearer to the erroneous 315, so that was likely the intended article.
